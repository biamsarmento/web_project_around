# 📸 Project Around

## 📖 About the Project

Around is an interactive photo-sharing platform that allows users to showcase their profiles and upload pictures.

The website features:
- A Profile section displaying the user's name, description, and an option to edit their details.
- A Photo gallery, where users can add and delete posts.
- Like functionality, where users can interact with posts.
- Pop-up modals, which can be closed by clicking outside or pressing the Esc key.
- Form validation, ensuring that data is correctly entered before submission.
- The latest updates introduced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, optimizing the code structure and organization. Additionally, the project now integrates with an API, allowing data storage and retrieval using authenticated requests.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project was to create a dynamic and user-friendly photo-sharing platform while reinforcing JavaScript, OOP, and API integration skills. The project aimed to improve the user experience through interactive elements and a structured approach to data handling.
